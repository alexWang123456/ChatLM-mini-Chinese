# A Small Chat with Chinese Language Model: ChatLM-Chinese-0.2B 
 [‰∏≠Êñá](./README.md)  | English

</div>

# 1. üëãIntroduction

Today's large language models tend to have large parameters, and consumer-grade computers are slow to do simple inference, let alone train a model from scratch. The goal of this project is to train a generative language models from scratch, including data cleaning, tokenizer training, model pre-training, SFT instruction fine-tuning, RLHF optimization, etc.

ChatLM-mini-Chinese is a small Chinese chat model with only 0.2B (added shared weight is about 210M) parameters. It can be pre-trained on  machine with a minimum of 4GB of GPU memory (`batch_size=1`, `fp16` or `bf16`), `float16` loading and inference only require a minimum of 512MB of GPU memory.

- Make public all pre-training, SFT instruction fine-tuning, and DPO preference optimization datasets sources.
- Use the `Huggingface` NLP framework, including `transformers`, `accelerate`, `trl`, `peft`, etc.
- Self-implemented `trainer`, supporting pre-training and SFT fine-tuning on a single machine with a single card or with multiple cards on a single machine. It supports stopping at any position during training and continuing training at any position.
- Pre-training: Integrated into end-to-end `Text-to-Text` pre-training, non-`mask` mask prediction pre-training.
     - Open source all data cleaning (such as standardization, document deduplication based on mini_hash, etc.), data set construction, data set loading optimization and other processes;
     - tokenizer multi-process word frequency statistics, supports tokenizer training of `sentencepiece` and `huggingface tokenizers`;
     - Pre-training supports checkpoint at any step, and training can be continued from the breakpoint;
     - Streaming loading of large datasets (GB level), supporting buffer data shuffling, does not use memory or hard disk as cache, effectively reducing memory and disk usage. configuring `batch_size=1, max_len=320`, supporting pre-training on a machine with at least 16GB RAM + 4GB GPU memory;
     - Training log record.
- SFT fine-tuning: open source SFT dataset and data processing process.
     - The self-implemented `trainer` supports prompt command fine-tuning and supports any breakpoint to continue training;
     - Support `sequence to sequence` fine-tuning of `Huggingface trainer`;
     - Supports traditional low learning rate and only trains fine-tuning of the decoder layer.
- RLHF Preference optimization: Use DPO to optimize all preferences.
     - Support using `peft lora` for preference optimization;
     - Supports model merging, `Lora adapter` can be merged into the original model.
- Support downstream task fine-tuning: [finetune_examples](./finetune_examples/info_extract/) gives a fine-tuning example of the **Triple Information Extraction Task**. The model dialogue capability after fine-tuning is still there.

If you need to do retrieval augmented generation (RAG) based on small models, you can refer to my other project [Phi2-mini-Chinese](https://github.com/charent/Phi2-mini-Chinese). For the code, see [rag_with_langchain.ipynb](https://github.com/charent/Phi2-mini-Chinese/blob/main/rag_with_langchain.ipynb)

# 2. üõ†Ô∏èChatLM-0.2B-Chinese model training process
## 2.1 Pre-training dataset
All datasets come from the **Single Round Conversation** dataset published on the Internet. After data cleaning and formatting, they are saved as parquet files. For the data processing process, see `utils/raw_data_process.py`. Main datasets include:

1. Community Q&A json version webtext2019zh-large-scale high-quality dataset, see: [nlp_chinese_corpus](https://github.com/brightmart/nlp_chinese_corpus). A total of 4.1 million, with 2.6 million remaining after cleaning.
2. baike_qa2019 encyclopedia Q&A, see: <https://aistudio.baidu.com/datasetdetail/107726>, a total of 1.4 million, and the remaining 1.3 million after waking up.
3. Chinese medical field question and answer dataset, see: [Chinese-medical-dialogue-data](https://github.com/Toyhom/Chinese-medical-dialogue-data), with a total of 790,000, and the remaining 790,000 after cleaning.
4. ~~Financial industry question and answer data, see: <https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/609821974>, a total of 770,000, and the remaining 520,000 after cleaning. ~~**The data quality is too poor and not used. **
5. Zhihu question and answer data, see: [Zhihu-KOL](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wangrui6/Zhihu-KOL), with a total of 1 million rows, and 970,000 rows remain after cleaning.
6. belle open source instruction training data, introduction: [BELLE](https://github.com/LianjiaTech/BELLE), download: [BelleGroup](https://huggingface.co/BelleGroup), only select `Belle_open_source_1M` , `train_2M_CN`, and `train_3.5M_CN` contain some data with short answers, no complex table structure, and translation tasks (no English vocabulary list), totaling 3.7 million rows, and 3.38 million rows remain after cleaning.
7. Wikipedia entry data, piece together the entries into prompts, the first `N` words of the encyclopedia are the answers, use the encyclopedia data of `202309`, and after cleaning, the remaining 1.19 million entry prompts and answers . Wiki download: [zhwiki](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/zhwiki/), convert the downloaded bz2 file to wiki.txt reference: [WikiExtractor](https://github.com/apertium/WikiExtractor).

The total number of datasets is 10.23 million: Text-to-Text pre-training set: 9.3 million, evaluation set: 25,000 (because the decoding is slow, the evaluation set is not set too large). ~~Test set: 900,000~~
SFT fine-tuning and DPO optimization datasets are shown below.

## 2.2 Model
T5 model (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer), for details, see the paper: [Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683).

The model source code comes from huggingface, see: [T5ForConditionalGeneration](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/t5/modeling_t5.py#L1557).

For model configuration, see [model_config.json](https://huggingface.co/charent/ChatLM-mini-Chinese/blob/main/config.json). The official `T5-base`: `encoder layer` and `decoder layer` are both 12 layers. In this project, these two parameters are modified to 10 layers.

Model parameters: 0.2B. Word list size: 29298, including only Chinese and a small amount of English.

## 2.3 Training process
hardware:
```bash
# Pre-training phase:
CPU: 28 vCPU Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6330 CPU @ 2.00GHz
Memory: 60 GB
GPU: RTX A5000 (24GB) * 2

# sft and dpo stages:
CPU: Intel(R) i5-13600k @ 5.1GHz
Memory: 32 GB
GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16GB * 1
```

1. **tokenizer training**: The existing `tokenizer` training library has OOM problems when encountering large corpus. Therefore, the full corpus is merged and constructed according to word frequency according to a method similar to `BPE`, and the operation takes half a day.
   
2. **Text-to-Text pre-training**: The learning rate is a dynamic learning rate from `1e-4` to `5e-3`, and the pre-training time is 8 days. Training loss:
![traing loss](img/train_loss.png)

3. **prompt supervised fine-tuning (SFT)**: Use the `belle` instruction training dataset (both instruction and answer lengths are below 512), with a dynamic learning rate from `1e-7` to `5e-5` , the fine-tuning time is 2 days. Fine-tuning loss:
![finetune loss](img/sft_loss.png)

4. **dpo direct preference optimizationÔºàRLHFÔºâ**: dataset [alpaca-gpt4-data-zh](https://huggingface.co/datasets/c-s-ale/alpaca-gpt4-data-zh) as `chosen` text , in step `2`, the SFT model performs batch `generate` on the prompts in the dataset, and obtains the `rejected` text, which takes 1 day, dpo full preference optimization, learning rate `le-5`, half precision `fp16`, total `2` `epoch`, taking 3h. dpo loss:
![dpo loss](img/dpo_loss.png)

## 2.4 chat show
### 2.4.1 stream chat
By default, `TextIteratorStreamer` of `huggingface transformers` is used to implement streaming dialogue, and only `greedy search` is supported. If you need `beam sample` and other generation methods, please change the `stream_chat` parameter of `cli_demo.py` to `False` .
![](./img/stream_chat.gif)

### 2.4.2 Dialogue show
![](./img/show1.png)

There are problems: the pre-training dataset only has more than 9 million, and the model parameters are only 0.2B. It cannot cover all aspects, and there will be situations where the answer is wrong and the generator is nonsense.

## 3.2 from clone code repository start
> [!CAUTION]
> The model of this project is the `TextToText` model. In the `prompt`, `response` and other fields of the pre-training stage, SFT stage, and RLFH stage, please be sure to add the `[EOS]` end-of-sequence mark.    

### 3.2.1 Clone repository
```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/charent/ChatLM-mini-Chinese.git

cd ChatLM-mini-Chinese
```
### 3.2.2 Install dependencies
It is recommended to use `python 3.10` for this project. Older python versions may not be compatible with the third-party libraries it depends on.

pip installation:
```bash
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

If pip installed the CPU version of pytorch, you can install the CUDA version of pytorch with the following command:
```bash
# pip install torch + cu118
pip3 install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

conda installation:
```bash
conda install --yes --file ./requirements.txt
```

### 3.2.3 Download the pre-trained model and model configuration file

Download model weights and configuration files from `Hugging Face Hub` with `git` command, you need to install [Git LFS](https://docs.github.com/zh/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large -file-storage), then run:

```bash
# Use the git command to download the huggingface model. Install [Git LFS] first, otherwise the downloaded model file will not be available.
git clone --depth 1 https://huggingface.co/charent/ChatLM-mini-Chinese

# If unable to connect huggingface, please download from modelscope
git clone --depth 1 https://www.modelscope.cn/charent/ChatLM-mini-Chinese.git

mv ChatLM-mini-Chinese model_save
```

You can also manually download it directly from the `Hugging Face Hub` warehouse [ChatLM-mini-Chinese](https://huggingface.co/charent/ChatLM-mini-Chinese) and move the downloaded file to the `model_save` directory. .
    

## 3.3 Tokenizer training

I originally planned to directly use the ready-made `tokenizer` library for training (such as `sentencepiece`), but it is easy to OOM when the dataset is large. In addition, the corpus in various fields of the pre-training dataset is unbalanced, which will produce many unnecessary mergers. Finally, use `jieba` word segmentation to segment all the pre-training corpus and count the word frequency, and only retain words and words that appear more than 1500 times. Refer to the `BPE model` saving format of `PreTrainedTokenizerFast` to construct `tokenzier`, and finally convert it to `PreTrainedTokenizerFast`. The core code is as follows. For detailed processing, see `utils/train_tokenizer.py`.

**This method is not a rigorous merge method. It ignores word frequency information and merges words that should not be merged. It is a compromise method for machines smaller than 16G. If you want to do pre-training, it is recommended to use the code of `train_tokenizer.ipynb` to retrain.**  

```python
# Construct merge array
words_merge_list = []
for word in words_dict.keys():
    n = len(word)
    if n >= 2:
        # a, b split 12345 exampleÔºö 1 2345,  12 345,   123 45,   1234 5
        for i in range(1, n):
            a, b = ''.join(word[0: i]), ''.join(word[i: ])

            if a in words_dict and b in words_dict:
                words_merge_list.append((a, b))
```
This project also provides an example of using the `tokenizer` that comes with the pre-trained model to retrain the `tokenizer` based on your own corpus, see `train_tokenizer.ipynb`. Note that after retraining `tokenizer`, the weights of the pre-trained model will not be available, and the model weights need to be retrained because the `id` corresponding to `token` has changed.

}
```

2. jupyter-lab or jupyter notebook:

     See the file `train.ipynb`. It is recommended to use jupyter-lab to avoid considering the situation where the terminal process is killed after disconnecting from the server.

3. Console:

    Console training needs to consider that the process will be killed after the connection is disconnected. It is recommended to use the process daemon tool `Supervisor` or `screen` to establish a connection session.

     First, configure `accelerate`, execute the following command, and select according to the prompts. Refer to `accelerate.yaml`, *Note: DeepSpeed installation in Windows is more troublesome*.
     ```bash
     accelerate config
     ```

     Start training. If you want to use the configuration provided by the project, please add the parameter `--config_file ./accelerate.yaml` after the following command `accelerate launch`. *This configuration is based on the single-machine 2xGPU configuration.*  

     *There are two scripts for pre-training. The trainer implemented in this project corresponds to `train.py`, and the trainer implemented by huggingface corresponds to `pre_train.py`. You can use either one and the effect will be the same. The training information display of the trainer implemented in this project is more beautiful, and it is easier to modify the training details (such as loss function, log records, etc.). All support checkpoint to continue training. The trainer implemented in this project supports continuing training after a breakpoint at any position. Press ` ctrl+c` will save the breakpoint information when exiting the script.*

     Single machine and single card:
     ```bash
     # The trainer implemented in this project
     accelerate launch ./train.py train

     # Or use huggingface trainer
    accelerate launch --multi_gpu --num_processes 2 pre_train.py
     ```

     Single machine with multiple GPUs:
     '2' is the number of gpus, please modify it according to your actual situation.
     ```bash
     # The trainer implemented in this project
     accelerate launch --multi_gpu --num_processes 2 ./train.py train

     # Or use huggingface trainer
    accelerate launch --multi_gpu --num_processes 2 pre_train.py
     ```

     Continue training from the breakpoint:
     ```bash
     # The trainer implemented in this project
     accelerate launch --multi_gpu --num_processes 2 ./train.py train --is_keep_training=True

     # Or use huggingface trainer
     # You need to add `resume_from_checkpoint=True` to the `train` function in `pre_train.py`
     python pre_train.py
     ```

## 3.5 Supervised Fine-tuning, SFT

The SFT dataset all comes from the contribution of [BELLE](https://github.com/LianjiaTech/BELLE). Thank you. The SFT datasets are: [generated_chat_0.4M](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BelleGroup/generated_chat_0.4M), [train_0.5M_CN](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BelleGroup/train_0.5M_CN ) and [train_2M_CN](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BelleGroup/train_2M_CN), about 1.37 million rows remain after cleaning.

Make your own dataset by referring to the sample `parquet` file in the `data` directory. The dataset format is: the `parquet` file is divided into two columns, one column of `prompt` text, representing the prompt, and one column of `response` text, representing the expected model. output.
For fine-tuning details, see the `train` method under `model/trainer.py`. When `is_finetune` is set to `True`, fine-tuning will be performed. Fine-tuning will freeze the embedding layer and encoder layer by default, and only train the decoder layer. If you need to freeze other parameters, please adjust the code yourself.

Run SFT fine-tuning:
```bash
# For the trainer implemented in this project, just add the parameter `--is_finetune=True`. The parameter `--is_keep_training=True` can continue training from any breakpoint.
accelerate launch --multi_gpu --num_processes 2 ./train.py --is_finetune=True

# Or use huggingface trainer
python sft_train.py
```

## 3.6 RLHF (Reinforcement Learning Human Feedback Optimization Method)

Here are two common preferred methods: PPO and DPO. Please search papers and blogs for specific implementations.

1. PPO method (approximate preference optimization, Proximal Policy Optimization)  
     Step 1: Use the fine-tuning dataset to do supervised fine-tuning (SFT, Supervised Finetuning).  
     Step 2: Use the preference dataset (a prompt contains at least 2 responses, one wanted response and one unwanted response. Multiple responses can be sorted by score, with the most wanted one having the highest score) to train the reward model (RM, Reward Model). You can use the `peft` library to quickly build the Lora reward model.   
     Step 3: Use RM to perform supervised PPO training on the SFT model so that the model meets preferences.   

2. Use DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) fine-tuning (**This project uses the DPO fine-tuning method, which saves GPU memory**)
     On the basis of obtaining the SFT model, there is no need to train the reward model, and fine-tuning can be started by obtaining the positive answer (chosen) and the negative answer (rejected). The fine-tuned `chosen` text comes from the original dataset [alpaca-gpt4-data-zh](https://huggingface.co/datasets/c-s-ale/alpaca-gpt4-data-zh), and the rejected text `rejected` comes from SFT Model output after fine-tuning 1 epoch, two other datasets: [huozi_rlhf_data_json](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Skepsun/huozi_rlhf_data_json) and [rlhf-reward-single-round-trans_chinese](https:// huggingface.co/datasets/beyond/rlhf-reward-single-round-trans_chinese), a total of 80,000 dpo data after the merger.
    
     For the dpo dataset processing process, see `utils/dpo_data_process.py`.
    
DPO preference optimization dataset example:
```json
    {
        "prompt": "‰∏∫ÁªôÂÆöÁöÑ‰∫ßÂìÅÂàõÂª∫‰∏Ä‰∏™ÂàõÊÑèÊ†áËØ≠„ÄÇÔºåËæìÂÖ•ÔºöÂèØÈáçÂ§ç‰ΩøÁî®ÁöÑÊ∞¥Áì∂„ÄÇ",
        "chosen": "\"‰øùÊä§Âú∞ÁêÉÔºå‰ªéÊã•ÊúâÂèØÈáçÂ§ç‰ΩøÁî®ÁöÑÊ∞¥Áì∂ÂºÄÂßãÔºÅ\"",
        "rejected": "\"ËÆ©‰Ω†ÁöÑÊ∞¥Áì∂Êàê‰∏∫‰Ω†ÁöÑÁîüÊ¥ª‰º¥‰æ£Ôºå‰ΩøÁî®ÂèØÈáçÂ§ç‰ΩøÁî®ÁöÑÊ∞¥Áì∂ÔºåËÆ©‰Ω†ÁöÑÊ∞¥Áì∂Êàê‰∏∫‰Ω†ÁöÑ‰ºô‰º¥\""
    }
```
Run preference optimization:
```bash

```

## 3.8 Fine-tuning of downstream tasks

Here we take the triplet information in the text as an example to do downstream fine-tuning. Traditional deep learning extraction methods for this task can be found in the repository [pytorch_IE_model](https://github.com/charent/pytorch_IE_model). Extract all the triples in a piece of text, such as the sentence `"Sketching Essays" is a book published by Metallurgical Industry in 2006, the author is Zhang Lailiang`, extract the triples `(Sketching Essays, author, Zhang Lailiang)` and `( Sketching essays, publishing house, metallurgical industry)`.

The original dataset is: [Baidu Triplet Extraction dataset](https://aistudio.baidu.com/datasetdetail/11384). Example of the processed fine-tuned dataset format:
```json
{
    "prompt": "ËØ∑ÊäΩÂèñÂá∫ÁªôÂÆöÂè•Â≠ê‰∏≠ÁöÑÊâÄÊúâ‰∏âÂÖÉÁªÑ„ÄÇÁªôÂÆöÂè•Â≠êÔºö„ÄäÂÆ∂‰π°ÁöÑÊúà‰∫Æ„ÄãÊòØÂÆãÈõ™Ëé±ÊºîÂî±ÁöÑ‰∏ÄÈ¶ñÊ≠åÊõ≤ÔºåÊâÄÂ±û‰∏ìËæëÊòØ„Ää‰πÖËøùÁöÑÂì•‰ª¨„Äã",
    "response": "[(ÂÆ∂‰π°ÁöÑÊúà‰∫Æ,Ê≠åÊâã,ÂÆãÈõ™Ëé±),(ÂÆ∂‰π°ÁöÑÊúà‰∫Æ,ÊâÄÂ±û‰∏ìËæë,‰πÖËøùÁöÑÂì•‰ª¨)]"
}
```

You can directly use the `sft_train.py` script for fine-tuning. The script [finetune_IE_task.ipynb](./finetune_examples/info_extract/finetune_IE_task.ipynb) contains the detailed decoding process. The training dataset is about `17000`, the learning rate is `5e-5`, and the training epoch is `5`. The dialogue capabilities of other tasks have not disappeared after fine-tuning.

Fine-tuning effects:
The public `dev` dataset of `Baidu triple extraction dataset` is used as a test set to compare with the traditional method [pytorch_IE_model](https://github.com/charent/pytorch_IE_model).

| Model | F1 score | Precision | Recall |
| :--- | :----: | :---: | :---: |
| ChatLM-Chinese-0.2B fine-tuning | 0.74 | 0.75 | 0.73 |
| ChatLM-Chinese-0.2B without pre-training | 0.51 | 0.53 | 0.49 |
| Traditional deep learning method | 0.80 | 0.79 | 80.1 |

Note: `ChatLM-Chinese-0.2B without pre-training` means directly initializing random parameters, starting training, learning rate `1e-4`, and other parameters are consistent with fine-tuning.
